In this project, we aim to build a **Database Management System** all from *scratch* in C.
The goal is to learn by building. The approach is simple, **Divide and Conquer** , the entire work was diivided into subproblems that can be easily solved, slowly paving our way to our goal.
##  Part 1: In-Memory Storage

We implemented in-memory "Pages" to store rows of data and a table structure to manage these pages.

### Features:
- Data is stored in the form of:
  - `Roll Number` (integer)
  - `Name` (string)
- Supported operations:
  - **Insert**
  - **Delete**
  - **Search**
  - **Print All Data**

During runtime, the program will prompt the user to enter required inputs for each operation.

- **Part 3**: [Coming Soon]
- **Part 4**: [Coming Soon]
- **Part 5**: [Coming Soon]

## Getting Started

1.>Clone the repo to your local machine.

2.>Open the terminal in folder which stores these files.

3.> type "make" and then .\main and boom! you will be presented with a menu of functionalities. you can then use the developed software.

4.> In case writing "make" throws a error, one may open a compiler like vs code and type: gcc -o main main.c functions.c myutils.c and then .\main and again the code will start running.
